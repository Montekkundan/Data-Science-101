# Problem Statement:

You work in XYZ Corporation as a Data Analyst. Your corporation has told you to use the numpy package and do some tasks related to that:


## Tasks to be performed:

- Create a 3x3 matrix array with values ranging from 2 to 10.
- Create a numpy array having user input values and convert the integer type to the float type of the elements of the array. For instance:
Original array
[1, 2, 3, 4]
Array converted to a float type: [ 1. 2. 3. 4.]
- Write a Numpy program to append values to the end of an array. For instance: Original array:
[10, 20, 30]
After append values to the end of the array: [10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90]
- Create two numpy arrays and add the elements of both the arrays and store the result in sumArray.
- Create a 3*3 array having values from 10-90(interval of 10) and store that in array1. Perform the following tasks:
- Extract the 1st row from the array.
- Extract the last element from the array.
