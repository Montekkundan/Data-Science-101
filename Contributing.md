# How to Contribute
You have a Data Science related problem in mind, or don't know how to start in this journey, this repository will help you get all the information.
Something is missing? If yes you could just go ahead and file an issue and very soon it'll be included in this repository.

First and foremost, fork this repository and clone it your computer/local machine. Once done then do the following changes:

  1. Create a folder dedicated to your task.
  2. In the folder, your files should have a **author** at the top with your name or your github profile link.
  3. Update the README.md file of the repository folder you are working with.

## Guide to create folders and files.

- If there is no folder of a specific topic in the root repository, create one.
- Create a folder inside the repositories default folders with specific naming conventions:
  - For assignments: `name_assignment_1` (change the number accordingly).
  - For assignments solutions :`name_solution_1` (change the number accordingly).
  - Update the README file of particular folder you are in.
  - All notes, or pdf notes should be under Notes folder.
  - Do create a specific folder under Notes folder if required.
  - If there is a specific folder already created, and you want more branching, create a specific sub folder in it.

## Folder Structure ans usage:

- Calculus
  - `README.md`
- Julia_lang
  - `README.md`
- Linear Algebra
  - `README.md`

    - Numpy_learning
      - assignments  -> All practise assignments related to numpy
        - numpy_assignment_1 -> assignment 1 
          - questions.md -> List of questions
          - solutions -> folder for solutions
            - `numpy_solution_1[Your name].py ` -> python file or juypter notebook with author name.
            - `understanding.md` -> Concepts used and explanation for the solutions
        - numpy_assignment_2
      -`README.md`
    - Pandas_learning
    - Seaborn_learning
